                  <p>The American bison is the mammal emblem of the United States, but did you know that it is also a symbol of conservation?
                    Before the start of the 19th century, more than 50 million bison roamed across North American forests and plains.
                    Within a century, that number had dropped to just a few hundred due to a government-supported hunting program that aimed to remove the bison as a food source of native Americans.
                    At the time such a drastic decline was unheard of, and concerns that the species may be lost forever sparked the formation of the American Bison Society in 1905.
                    Two years later, the translocation of 15 animals to Bronx Zoo marked the first active conservation efforts for this species, and among the first for any species.
                    Since then, bison have been bred in captive and free-ranging populations around the world.
                    Now half a million bison live, with all but 19,000 of these existing in captivity or under significant management.
                    While this is less than 1% of what they once numbered, it is remarkable that this species has persisted at all.

                  <p>In 1996, the Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) was discovered.
                    This was a contagious cancer known only to Tasmanian devils, with symptoms including the formation of large tumours on the face.
                    The disease is always lethal, killing infected animals within about 6 months.
                    However, within that time, infected devils can spread the disease to other individuals through biting, a natural display of aggression.
                    As a result, the disease has spread across most of Tasmania in the last 20 years, wiping out 85% of the population.
                    To combat this, zoos in Australia, Europe and the United States are involved in holding and maintaining healthy captive populations.
                    Now, there are more than 700 captive devils held in about 50 zoos around the world.
                    Some of these are being successfully released onto Maria Island to join a wild, disease-free population.

                  <p>The golden lion tamarin is a small, colourful monkey found in the Atlantic Forest of South America.
                    This area of rainforest has been subject to extensive logging in the past, leading to the destruction of the tamarin's home.
                    By the 1970s, only a handful of pockets of suitable habitat remained for the species.
                    Its population dropped to a low of just a few hundred and it seemed that the golden lion tamarin was headed for extinction.
                    However, they have made a comeback through the the efforts of the "Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Program", run by the National Zoo in Washington, DC.
                    Deforested areas are being bought back and restored, with wild populations supported through the release of captive-bred individuals.
                    By 2000, about 350 tamarins had been released into the wild from zoos.
                    Now, at least one third of the wild golden lion tamarin population are descended from captive-bred individuals.

                  <p>With a 10 foot wingspan, the California condor is an enormous vulture, and the largest land bird in North America.
                    While there are now a few hundred of these magnificent birds soaring through the skies, there was a time when they had disappeared.
                    California condors are threatened primarily by lead-poisoning through the consumption of animals which had been shot with lead ammunition.
                    They are also threatened by other poisons (such as DDT), poaching and a loss of habitat.
                    Between 1982 and 1987, the last wild condors were taken to the San Diego Zoo and Safari Park in a last-ditch effort to save the species.
                    There were only 22.
                    In 1988, the first California condor was born in captivity, marking the start of an incredible success story.
                    Since 1992, these zoo-born condors have been returned to the wild.
                    The wild population is now approaching 300, with a further 180 in captivity.

                  <p>The addax is a stunning antelope of northern Africa with extravagant, twisting horns.
                    Unfortunately, these horns are valuable in the black market, and poaching has led to rapid population declines.
                    Political instability and the search for oil have made conservation efforts in this region difficult, and allowed further poaching to go unrestricted.
                    Addax now persist in only six wild populations, three of which are made up of individuals reintroduced from captivity.
                    The total wild population is now probably less than 100 individuals, but a couple thousand survive in zoos and in captively-managed herds.
                    Until the serious threats of poaching can be managed, maintaining a healthy population of addax in zoos is our best chance to ensure the species can remain for years to come.

                  <p>The Lord Howe Island Stick Insect, colloquially known as the land lobster, is a giant ground-dwelling insect which once lived on Lord Howe Island, between Australia and New Zealand.
                    In 1918, a supply ship named SS Makambo ran aground on the island, releasing a group of stowaway rats.
                    Within two years, these rats had eaten every last stick bug on the island.
                    As far as anyone knew, the land lobster had gone extinct - and it remained that way for over 80 years.
                    But in 2001, they were rediscovered by a rock-climber scaling up the sheer cliffs of an ocean rock stack 14 miles away.
                    The entire species' population (24 bugs) was hanging on in the leaf litter under a single bush.
                    In 2003, a single pair was brought to Melbourne Zoo and the first of what would become tens of thousands of captive-born stick bugs were hatched.
                    If the proposed rat eradication next year is successful, the species may soon be returned to its original home.

                  <p>The northern white rhinoceros is a distinct subspecies of the white rhinoceros, once found across central Africa.
                    Poaching in the '70s and '80s led to population declines until it had reached a low of just 15 individuals.
                    Conservation efforts over the next two decades allowed the population to double, but this would not last.
                    As poaching intensified once more, the northern white rhinoceros went extinct in the wild by 2008.
                    At the beginning of this year, there were just three individuals living semi-wild at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.
                    By March, the last male had died.
                    San Diego Zoo is now looking into using modern genetic technology to implant a northern white rhinoceros embryo into a female of the closely-related southern white rhinoceros.
                    If this is successful, there is hope that northern white rhinoceroses might roam free once more.
