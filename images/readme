This is just a folder to store all imagery used in this project. There are a few general guidelines to image use for this project:
  1. Please keep all the images used for the project hosted in here.
  2. When possible, use SVGs over PNG or JPEG files for optimization reasons.
  3. In general, icons should follow the set color scheme and utilize one of four color schemes:
        Red - #f37852, #d7623e
        Yellow - #f3af52, #d89130
        Blue-green - #799e8f, #608e7b
        White (generally only used for UX/UI icons) - #ffffff
  4. Keep in mind that for this project, color also carries meaning, so iconography should be used with care to either continue or at least no contradict that meaning, as described below:
        Red - endangerment/extinction/bad
        Blue-green - hope/survival/recovery
        Yellow - (less strict a theme) informational/call to action
