# See the Bigger Picture
An interactive and narrative website designed to inform the general public on the good zoos do for global conservation, while addressing the misconception that animals in zoos are unhappy or mistreated. Overall, the hope is that the public will "see the bigger picture" and realize that having just a few animals in zoos does so much to benefit the rest of the animals in the wild. A project for ART 574 Bookforms, University of Louisville 2018.

## Introduction
This project is primarily a design project, not a development one. Although the website is coded from scratch, this code is fairly old and probably not as optimized as it could be. The emphasis is on using design and user-interaction to convey a message through a narrative experience.

## Concept
The concept for the project began with a tagline, "see the bigger picture," encouraging the audience to think about the well-being of all animals, not just the few held in zoos. Playing off of the visual element of seeing more than what's immediately visible, the project began to take on to a sort of "hide and seek" interactive concept where more animals are revealed as the user scrolls.

The illustrative style and rhyming verbage serves to make the message more approachable and heighten the sense of "story".

## Illustration
All illustrations were created in Adobe Photoshop and then exported in several layers to allow for the parallax effect seen on desktop. The lighting effect that shows/hides additional animals in the background is a separate layer that becomes visible as the user scrolls. In addition to considering layer completeness, all illustrations needed to make sense on both mobile and desktop, and so have a central focal point of action that is centered on in mobile screens.

## Notes
### Processing Limitations
This website is intended to be mostly a proof-of-concept, and has a target audience of college students. With this in mind, the website is not optimized for poor internet connections, slower devices, or outdated browsers. Although there is some reduction of effects on mobile devices, the website may still seem slow on older machines. In a real-world setting, these issues would be addressed better, but this was a school project.
